# MIMO - Money In. Money Out. #

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

  MIMO - Money In. Money Out.

## Sub-Heading ##
  <!-- > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title. -->

  "For innovative individuals or teams looking to build an interactive financial model for their startup."

## Summary ##
  <!-- > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good. -->

  MIMO works to lower the barrier to entry into the starup community by helping users build interactive financial models tailored to reflect their start-up-s monetary needs.

  <!-- Lowers the barrier to entry into the venture capitalist world. -->

  "MIMO guides users through the process of building a financial model with a series of questions, generating a customized financial model that the user can further tailor to reflect their start-up's financial needs."

  "Helps individuals or teams who may not have any experience creating financial models build an attractive and expressive financial model that can be used to help them vie for venture capital."

## Problem ##
  <!-- > Describe the problem your product solves. -->

  Without prior knowledge of finance, the user will find the current model time consuming, unintuitive, and ambiguous because of assumptions built into the model, leading to a lack of insight and understanding of the analytics performed.
  The combination of these factors complicates the process of getting a start-up off the ground. 


<!--   The current tools used to build financial models suck:
    time consuming
      - should be able to do that in an hour.
    clunky
    takes forever to change anything
    requires deep knowledge of financial models and statistics
      - anyone with an idea should be able to express their financial prospectus with potential investors
    ambiguous
      - no insight into your data model
      - build platform is intuitive
    hidden assumptions
      - the assumptions that the current models are based on are unclear or not explained. 
      - models should offer insight on how they work and how they are construction the data visualizations
      - should be able to understand the analytics being performed and explain the results to ivestors. 
 -->
## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  Our product revolutionizes the process of creating a financial model by assuming no prior knowledge of the process on behalf of the user. MIMO guides users through building the essential components of viable balance sheets and cash flow statementsâ€”two essential components investors require from nascent start-ups.
