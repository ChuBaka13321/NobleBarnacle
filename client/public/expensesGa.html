	The first page a user will see if they select to create a new model from our landing page. Thinking this view will share a controller with the other expenses views. I believe we need a unique page for each of the three categories as we will want different user input form layouts. In this page we should have some necessary categories such as marketing and the ability to enter additional categories with an 'other' field. -->
